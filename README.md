# Community Playbooks

This is the 4.13 branch of the Phantom Community Playbooks repository, which contains the default initial playbooks and custom functions for each Phantom instance. For older versions of Phantom there are other branches such as [4.10](https://github.com/phantomcyber/playbooks/tree/4.10) and [4.9](https://github.com/phantomcyber/playbooks/tree/4.9)

The Phantom platform automatically links to the branch of this repository that matches the running Phantom version. By default this repository is named **community**, which can be selected as the **Repo** filter to only display these playbooks and custom functions. You can update your content with the **Update from source control** button on the playbook listing page.
